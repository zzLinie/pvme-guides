I don't ask for much. I live a simple life, honest work. I wake up at dawn, get ready for work, read DMs on Discord, and come back to a hot meal. But every now and then I need a little break, you know? And there's only one thing that relaxes me enough to get me going through every day. It's just a small thing. I go to a Discord server and wait. What am I waiting for you ask? Well, irons of course. And what do irons do most? Complain. It's this moment that I savor. At their lowest moment, I swoop in and say, "Iron issue lmao. Just de-iron". Nothing beats that rush. Nothing ever will. It's what I live for.
